This repository contains various test scripts and examples.

## arrayMethods.js

This script provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using common JavaScript array methods. It's designed to be an educational resource, demonstrating each method with clear explanations and practical examples.

The methods are categorized for easier learning:

*   **Iteration Methods**: `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
*   **Search and Test Methods**: `find()`, `findIndex()`, `includes()`, `some()`, `every()`
*   **Modifying Array Methods (Mutators)**: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `splice()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`
*   **Non-Modifying Array Methods (Accessors/Creators)**: `slice()`, `concat()`, `join()`, `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `flat()`, `flatMap()`

Each method's explanation includes its purpose, return value, and notes on its behavior (e.g., whether it modifies the original array).

To run the script and see the examples in action, navigate to the `test_repo` directory and execute:

```bash
node arrayMethods.js
```
